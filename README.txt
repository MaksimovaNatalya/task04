I've done in my application:
	1. Localization (2 languages - English and Russian)
	2. User registration
	3. User authorization 
 	4. Hashed passwords by Bcrypt + check of hashing password in authorization
 	5. Page to observe rooms of the hotel
 	6. Room booking module (after filling the fields user sees rooms available according to the given criteria - and may book any of them)
 	7. User account
 	8. Change user info function
 	9. Page with all user's bookings with the possibility to cancel the booking (if it has not been processed by admin)
  	10. For admin - page with all the requests for rooms (with possible options either to approve or to decline a new request). The status of the request is also seen by user.
	11. Log out function
 	12. Simple validation of parameters
 	13. Connection pool
 	14. CharSet Filter
 	15. SessionListener and RequestListener
 	16. Logging
 	17. JUnit, simple tests
	
I would also like to add:
	1. Possibility to look up guest's info from the request by admin
	2. Possibility to add guests to the black list
  	3. Possibility to filter available rooms by parameters
  	4. Possibility to change password 
	5. Full validation of parameters
